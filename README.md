# Musical Instruments Store Thread Simulator

This is an educational project simulating the work of a store (through the example of a Musical Instruments Store),
including customers traffic changes, queues, shopping carts, printing cash receipts, different types of customers,
discounts and in-store attendance limitations.
Project is using multithreading tools in order to simulate customers simultaneous activity (one thread per one customer)
.
